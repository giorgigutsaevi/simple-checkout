# Project: Simple Checkout

## To achieve these goals:

- "I know how my language works"
- "I can build with objects"
- "I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan
Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of a number of items. Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

>As a shopper\
>So I know how much an item costs\
>I would like to be able to see its price

>As a shopper\
>So that I can buy an item\
>I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout

>As a shopper\
>So that I know how much to pay\
>I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items

>As a shopper\
>So that I know how much to pay\
>I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (Â£xx.xx)


## Evidence Plan
- You'll be able to explain the approach you took to writing your code and justify some of the decisions you made (emotional)
- You will have a well tested, working implementation of the system described above (empirical)
- You will discuss your approach with a coach, describing your TDD process, and will receive feedback (credible)
