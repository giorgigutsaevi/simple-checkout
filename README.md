# Project: Simple Checkout

## To achieve these goals:

"I know how my language works"
"I can build with objects"
"I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan
Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of a number of items. Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.


## Evidence Plan
- You'll be able to explain the approach you took to writing your code and justify some of the decisions you made (emotional)
- You will have a well tested, working implementation of the system described above (empirical)
- You will discuss your approach with a coach, describing your TDD process, and will receive feedback (credible)
